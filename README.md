### Builder Design Pattern
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

#### Use the Builder pattern when
1. the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled.
2. the construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed.
